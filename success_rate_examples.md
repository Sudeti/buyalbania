# Dynamic Success Rate Examples

## How the System Adapts to Real Data

The system doesn't assume any fixed percentage - it calculates the actual success rate from your scraping data. Here are different scenarios:

## ðŸ“Š **Scenario 1: High Quality Pages (100% Success Rate)**

**Real Data:**
- 50 pages processed
- 600 properties scraped
- Average: 12.0 properties per page

**Calculation:**
```python
success_rate = 12.0 / 12 = 1.0 (100%)
properties_per_successful_page = 12 * 1.0 = 12.0
```

**Result:** Every page contains scrapable properties - very efficient!

## ðŸ“Š **Scenario 2: Good Pages (80% Success Rate)**

**Real Data:**
- 50 pages processed  
- 480 properties scraped
- Average: 9.6 properties per page

**Calculation:**
```python
success_rate = 9.6 / 12 = 0.8 (80%)
properties_per_successful_page = 12 * 0.8 = 9.6
```

**Result:** Most pages have properties, good efficiency.

## ðŸ“Š **Scenario 3: Mixed Pages (60% Success Rate)**

**Real Data:**
- 50 pages processed
- 360 properties scraped  
- Average: 7.2 properties per page

**Calculation:**
```python
success_rate = 7.2 / 12 = 0.6 (60%)
properties_per_successful_page = 12 * 0.6 = 7.2
```

**Result:** About half the pages have properties - moderate efficiency.

## ðŸ“Š **Scenario 4: Poor Pages (40% Success Rate)**

**Real Data:**
- 50 pages processed
- 240 properties scraped
- Average: 4.8 properties per page

**Calculation:**
```python
success_rate = 4.8 / 12 = 0.4 (40%)
properties_per_successful_page = 12 * 0.4 = 4.8
```

**Result:** Many pages are empty - low efficiency.

## ðŸ“Š **Scenario 5: Very Poor Pages (30% Success Rate)**

**Real Data:**
- 50 pages processed
- 180 properties scraped
- Average: 3.6 properties per page

**Calculation:**
```python
success_rate = 3.6 / 12 = 0.3 (30% - minimum allowed)
properties_per_successful_page = 12 * 0.3 = 3.6
```

**Result:** Most pages are empty - very low efficiency.

## ðŸ”„ **How Resume Calculation Adapts**

### Example: 1,000 properties in database

| Success Rate | Properties/Page | Estimated Page | Resume Page |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| 100% | 12.0 | 83 | 82 |
| 80% | 9.6 | 104 | 103 |
| 60% | 7.2 | 139 | 138 |
| 40% | 4.8 | 208 | 207 |
| 30% | 3.6 | 278 | 277 |

## ðŸ§  **Why This Matters**

**Old System (Fixed 12 properties/page):**
- Always assumes 12 properties per page
- Could be completely wrong if your success rate is different
- Leads to incorrect resume points

**New System (Dynamic):**
- Learns from your actual scraping patterns
- Adapts to your specific website and market conditions
- Provides accurate resume points based on real data

## ðŸ“ˆ **Self-Improving Over Time**

The system gets better as you scrape more:

1. **Initial scraping:** Uses conservative estimates
2. **After 50+ properties:** Calculates real success rate
3. **Ongoing scraping:** Continuously refines the calculation
4. **Market changes:** Automatically adapts to new patterns

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Your Actual Rate**

Run this to see your real success rate:
```bash
python test_success_rate.py
```

Or test the resume calculation:
```bash
python manage.py bulk_scrape_initial --test-resume
```

The system will show you exactly what success rate it calculated and why!
